# SOLID
# S : single responsibilty
# O : open close principle
# L : Lescov's principle
# I : Interface segrigation 
# D : Dependency inversion principle


# Every code unit (class/method/packages) only single responsibilty to take care

# Only one reason to change

# ways to figure out breaking of single rule principal

# # too many if else


# Open close principle : open for extension but close for modification
# extenstion : adding new feature
# modification : modifying the feature


# Lescov's principle
# what ever is the child class it can replace parent class with out breaking behaviour
# you should not write method which does not support


# Interface segrigation
# Single responsibility of abstract classes or inter faces
# No Two concrete Implement tation should be directly dependent on each other Instead They Should be dependent via abstract classes
